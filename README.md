## Models of neural and synaptic activity using Brian2. For BME503 - Computational Neuroengineering

This project is a publication-style presentation of the fundamentals of neural modeling as well as an
exploration of the applications of sensorimotor network models that simulate biologically-
inspired behavior. Using a combination of Izhikevich neuron models and alpha-type synapse models, I built
a "bug" that operates in a virtual environment and responds to a food stimulus (An example of this behavior can be
found (in this YouTube video)[https://youtu.be/WNCb4-n_yew]. The bug is designed after the Braitenberg vehicles first
conceived by Valentino Braitenberg.

All applications explored in this study are implemented in the Python
package, Brian 2, and can be found at GitHub.com/orbitalhybridization/BasicNeuralModeling. \
